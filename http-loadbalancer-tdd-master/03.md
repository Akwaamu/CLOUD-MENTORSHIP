# Configuration

Chapter three covers the implementation of a configuration file for our load balancer. We'll explore why there's a need for configuration files and what problems they help to solve. Towards the end we'll also see how our TDD approach helps us move faster.

## Why Config Files

Configuration files are common for all sorts of applications whether they are exposed via GUIs or modified by hand. They give us the ability to tweak applications for different needs and allows us to change the behavior for different environments. We can also keep our configuration out of our code which results in less code changes.

## Introducing Change

Before making any changes, let's take a step back to review: We currently have a load balancer that works as expected and we're about to introduce a fairly major change. This is where our tests will play a big part. We can verify that after we implement this change our tests still pass. If they still pass we can be reasonably confident that we won't break anything or change the behavior of our application.

## Implementation

### Host-based Routing

Instead of hardcoding the following backend servers for each host, we'll define them in our configuration file:

```
MANGO_BACKENDS = ["localhost:8081", "localhost:8082"]
APPLE_BACKENDS = ["localhost:9081", "localhost:9082"]
```

Create a *loadbalancer.yaml* file:

```yaml
# loadbalancer.yaml

hosts:
  - host: www.mango.com
    servers:
      - localhost:8081
      - localhost:8082
  - host: www.apple.com
    servers:
      - localhost:9081
      - localhost:9082
```

To use this file in our code, install [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) in the *Dockerfile*:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3
RUN pip install flask pyyaml
COPY ./app.py /app/app.py
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]
```

Next, update *loadbalancer.py*:

```python
# loadbalancer.py

import random

import requests
import yaml
from flask import Flask, request


loadbalancer = Flask(__name__)


def load_configuration(path):
    with open(path) as config_file:
        config = yaml.load(config_file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
    return config


config = load_configuration('loadbalancer.yaml')


@loadbalancer.route('/')
def router():
    host_header = request.headers['Host']
    for entry in config['hosts']:
        if host_header == entry['host']:
            response = requests.get(f'http://{random.choice(entry["servers"])}')
            return response.content, response.status_code
    return 'Not Found', 404

...
```

Here, we imported the `yaml` module and defined a `load_configuration` function to load *loadbalancer.yaml* into a Python dictionary. The `router` function then iterates through the `hosts` list defined in our configuration file and checks if the `host` key matches the Host header. If there's a match we sent a request to the backend servers defined in the `servers` otherwise we return a 404.

Build the image:

```sh
$ docker build -t server .
```

We can now run our tests:

```sh
(env)$ pip install pyyaml
(env)$ make test
```

Four out of six should pass:

```sh

### Path-based Routing

Update the config file like so:

```yaml
# loadbalancer.yaml

hosts:
  - host: www.mango.com
    servers:
      - localhost:8081
      - localhost:8082
  - host: www.apple.com
    servers:
      - localhost:9081
      - localhost:9082
paths:
  - path: /mango
    servers:
      - localhost:8081
      - localhost:8082
  - path: /apple
    servers:
      - localhost:9081
      - localhost:9082
```

We can now combine `mango_path` and `apple_path` into a single view function:

```python
@loadbalancer.route('/<path>')
def path_router(path):
    for entry in config['paths']:
        if ('/' + path) == entry['path']:
            response = requests.get(f'http://{random.choice(entry["servers"])}')
            return response.content, response.status_code
    return 'Not Found', 404
```

We iterated through the `paths` key and matched it with the path given in the URL, and then sent a request to the matching backend. If nothing is matched then we returned a 404.

*loadbalancer.py* should now look like this:

```python
# loadbalancer.py

import random

import requests
import yaml
from flask import Flask, request

loadbalancer = Flask(__name__)


def load_configuration(path):
    with open(path) as config_file:
        config = yaml.load(config_file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)
    return config


config = load_configuration('loadbalancer.yaml')


@loadbalancer.route('/')
def router():
    host_header = request.headers['Host']
    for entry in config['hosts']:
        if host_header == entry['host']:
            response = requests.get(f'http://{random.choice(entry["servers"])}')
            return response.content, response.status_code
    return 'Not Found', 404


@loadbalancer.route('/<path>')
def path_router(path):
    for entry in config['paths']:
        if ('/' + path) == entry['path']:
            response = requests.get(f'http://{random.choice(entry["servers"])}')
            return response.content, response.status_code
    return 'Not Found', 404
```

The tests should pass:

```sh
(env)$ make test

## Conclusion

We implemented a configuration file for our load balancer application and covered reasons for why adding a configuration file makes development more flexible. Taking a TDD approach paid off for us because we were able implement this change knowing that the behavior of our application did not change.
